E-Commerce Platform with Integrated Payment Processing

Our E-Commerce Platform is a robust and scalable solution built using Go (Golang) and the GoFiber web framework. It provides essential features for online shopping, including product browsing, user authentication, shopping cart management, and seamless payment processing. The platform leverages the Stripe payment gateway to securely handle transactions, ensuring a smooth and secure shopping experience for users.

Key Features:

    Product Management: The platform allows for the addition, removal, and modification of products. Each product includes details such as name, price, and quantity.

    User Authentication: Users can create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles. Authentication ensures a personalized experience, enabling features like order history and saved carts.

    Shopping Cart: A user-friendly shopping cart system allows customers to add products, adjust quantities, and review their selections before proceeding to checkout.

    Checkout Process: Seamless integration with Stripe enables a secure and straightforward checkout process. Customers can enter their payment details, and the platform handles payment confirmation, providing a reliable and trustworthy transaction experience.

Implementation Highlights:

    Project Structure: The project follows a modular structure with separate components for routes, models, handlers, and controllers. This promotes code organization and maintainability.

    Product and Cart Models: The models include structures for products, users, and shopping carts. The cart model includes cart items with product IDs and quantities.

    Handlers: Handlers are implemented for products, users, and carts, providing functionalities such as retrieving product information, managing the shopping cart, and initiating payments.

    Payment Processing: The integration of Stripe for payment processing enhances the platform's capabilities. The payment_handler.go file includes logic to initiate a payment session using Stripe Checkout.

    Routing: Routes are defined in separate files for better code structure. The application supports routes for products, user authentication, shopping cart management, and payment processing.

By combining the power of Go and GoFiber with the industry-leading payment processing capabilities of Stripe, our E-Commerce Platform provides a foundation for building a secure, efficient, and feature-rich online shopping experience. This platform serves as a starting point for further enhancements, such as order processing, user reviews, and more, to meet the evolving needs of online businesses.
